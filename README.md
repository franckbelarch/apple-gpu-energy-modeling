# GPU Energy Modeling & Analysis Project

This repository contains my passion project for GPU energy modeling and analysis, focusing particularly on Apple's innovative GPU designs. I've developed a comprehensive framework to understand, measure, and optimize GPU power consumption, demonstrating practical approaches to micro-architectural level energy models, what-if analysis, and identification of power optimization opportunities.

My fascination with Apple's approach to GPU design, especially their focus on performance-per-watt and the unique tile-based deferred rendering architecture, inspired this exploration of energy efficiency modeling techniques.

## Technical Areas Explored

- GPU architecture knowledge (focusing on Apple's design)
- VLSI power fundamentals
- Python data analysis and visualization
- Statistical modeling and machine learning
- Software/hardware co-optimization

## Model Validation Framework

The project includes a comprehensive validation framework that ensures the energy model's accuracy and methodological soundness:

- **Theoretical Validation**: Tests that the model correctly predicts how power scales with compute and memory utilization
- **TBDR Architecture Validation**: Verifies energy impact of tile memory access patterns and visibility determination
- **Literature Comparison**: Benchmarks model predictions against published research findings
- **Verification Methodology**: Detailed in VERIFICATION.md with academic citations and test procedures

The validation framework demonstrates that our modeling approach is firmly grounded in established research and produces results that align with both theoretical expectations and published literature.

## Next Steps & Ongoing Development

This project reflects my ongoing interest in GPU energy optimization and I'm actively working to enhance it with:

1. Deeper analysis of Apple's hardware-specific optimization techniques
2. Comparative studies with other modern GPU architectures
3. Advanced ML-based predictive models for energy consumption
4. Real-time optimization suggestions for developers
5. Integration with Metal framework for more accurate profiling

I welcome collaboration and feedback from others interested in GPU architecture and energy efficiency!
